# Memetoo
Linux Distro based on Gentoo with a focus on speed, efficiency, optimization, minimalism, and being a straight-up meme. 
## Features
* Utilizing LTO, Graphite, and -O3, Memetoo uses only the most aggressive make.conf for a fast experience.
* Memetoo has its own binary repository for tested packages compiled with our custom USE flags, ensuring performance while saving you time!
* Memetoo also includes documentation and instructions for building your own custom kernel! To help squeeze out as much performance as possible!
* Memetoo comes preconfigured with DWM, Urxvt, PCManFM, Vim, and Doas for the most minimal, performant Linux Distro yet!
## Installation
For now, we recommend using the Gentoo liveCD while following our installation instructions.
